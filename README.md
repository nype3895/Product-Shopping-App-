Project Overview
For this assignment, I designed a product checkout experience inspired by the Nike mobile app layout. I selected a jacket I purchased from Urban Outfitters and used a picture of myself as the product image. The process involved designing the wireframe in Figma, then importing my designs into Principle to add motion and interactivity.

Process & Challenges
Wireframing & UI Design:
I first built out the app’s structure in Figma, focusing on a clean and user-friendly shopping flow.

Importing to Principle:
Initially, I was confused about how to import my designs. I assumed I could simply copy and paste from Figma, but after searching for tutorials, I realized there was a specific process for importing files. This was a learning curve, but once I understood it, I was able to move forward.

Animating the Add-to-Cart Interaction:
The goal was to shrink the product image and smoothly move it into the shopping bag.
At first, I struggled with figuring out animation controls, especially how to properly shrink and transition the image.
Many tutorials moved too fast or had strong accents that made them hard to follow, so I decided to experiment on my own.
To my surprise, once I figured out how to animate in Principle, the process was simpler than expected—I didn't need to overcomplicate the movement.

Key Learnings & Breakthroughs
Getting Comfortable with Principle:
While I'm not fully confident in using Principle yet, this assignment helped me gain familiarity with its tools.
Slowing Down Animations for Better Visibility:
I adjusted the animation speed to make the transition clearer, ensuring users could visibly see the product moving into the cart.

Persistence Pays Off:
Normally, when I try something new and struggle, I tend to quit. However, I pushed through my challenges with Principle and ended up ecstatic when I successfully completed the animation. I even clapped at the end because I was so proud of what I accomplished.

Final Thoughts
This assignment was a huge confidence boost in working with motion design tools. While there’s still room to grow, I’m excited to keep learning and refining my skills in Principle and UI animations.
